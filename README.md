#### Description: A Wikipedia Fill-in-the-blanks app

---

When the user opens the app, it displays the text from a random Wikipedia page. 10 random words from the text are replaced by blanks and the user needs to guess what those words are. When the user taps / clicks on a blank, a list of all the 10 words are shown (shuffled, of course!) and the user can choose one of them. The UI updates to show that the user has filled up that blank. The user can tap / click a submit button once he’s done and the app shows him his score out of 10. If the user does not fill any particular blank, then he does not get points for it. Along with the user score, a button to “Replay” the game is displayed. Upon tapping / clicking it, the game begins again with another random Wikipedia page.

Playing this is quite tough.
